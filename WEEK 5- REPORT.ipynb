    "# Methodology\n",
    "The main objective here is to asses which city in United Kingdom would have the closest park for the runner. I used the Four Square API . I used the near query to get park in the cities. Also, I use the CategoryID to set it to show only Park. \n",
    "\n",
    "An Example of my requests:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/build-with-foursquare/categories/\n",
    "\n",
    "4bf58dd8d48988d163941735 is the Id of the Park Category. Also, Foursquare limits us to maximum of 100 venues per query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, I repeated this request for the 5 studied cities and got their top 100 venues. \n",
    "The popular running location is saved in Runners_Paradise.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, to get an indicator of the density of all the identified parks in United Kingdom, I calculated a center coordinate of the venues to get the mean longitude and latitude values. Then I calculated the mean of the Euclidean distance from each venue to the mean coordinates. That was my indicator; mean distance to the mean coordinate."
